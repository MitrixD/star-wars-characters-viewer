# STAR WARS characters viewer

## Project Description

This project is a React and TypeScript Single Page Application (SPA) that utilizes the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) as the data source. The application consists of two pages: the Home Page and the Character Details Page.

### Home Page
The Home Page displays a list of characters in the form of cards. The page incorporates pagination and search functionality using the Star Wars API. Users can navigate through the list of characters using the pagination controls, as well as search for specific characters by name using the search bar.

### Character Details Page
The Character Details Page provides comprehensive information about a selected character. Users can view details such as the character's height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, and gender. Additionally, the page allows users to edit the character's information locally without sending any changes to the server.
