# Star Wars characters explorer

React and TypeScript Single Page Application (SPA) using the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) as the data source. The application consists of two pages.

1. Home Page:
- Display a list or cards of characters.
- Implement pagination and search functionality using the API.
2. Character Details Page:
- Display detailed information about the selected character.
- Allow local editing of the character's information without sending it to the server.
